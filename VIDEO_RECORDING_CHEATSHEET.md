📌 What This Project Is

Digital FTE is not a chatbot.

It is a Production-Ready Autonomous AI Employee that:

Monitors events continuously

Generates structured execution plans

Executes real-world actions via MCP

Enforces approval gates for sensitive tasks

Logs all activity for auditability

Operates 24/7 using hybrid Cloud + Local zones

Inspired by Agent Factory principles and Digital FTE architecture.

🧠 System Architecture

Detects:

Emails

File changes

Scheduled tasks

Business triggers

Creates structured Markdown tasks inside the Vault.

2️⃣ Reasoning Layer

Claude:

Reads /Needs_Action

Generates Plan.md

Applies guardrails

Manages state transitions

State Flow:

Inbox → Needs_Action → Pending_Approval → Approved → Done

3️⃣ Action Layer (MCP)

Integrated:

Email execution

LinkedIn drafting

Odoo accounting (JSON-RPC)

File operations

Sensitive actions require human approval.
