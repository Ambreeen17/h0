## Overview

We need to research, design, and implement a new feature for the AI Employee system. This involves analyzing user requirements, creating technical specifications, developing the solution, testing thoroughly, and documenting the implementation.

The feature should integrate with existing Watchers, add new capabilities to the TaskProcessor, and enhance the Dashboard with new visualization options.

After that, we need to coordinate with the team to review the implementation, gather feedback, make necessary revisions, and prepare for deployment.

Finally, we should create user documentation, run integration tests, and monitor the system for any issues post-deployment.

### Context

This is a complex, multi-phase project that requires careful planning and coordination across multiple teams and components.
