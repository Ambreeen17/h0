**Digital FTE is not a chatbot.**

It is a **Production-Ready Autonomous AI Employee** that:

- Monitors events continuously
- Generates structured execution plans

- Logs all activity for auditability
- Operates 24/7 using hybrid Cloud + Local zones

Inspired by **Agent Factory** principles and **Digital FTE** architecture.

## 🧠 System Architecture

### 1️⃣ Perception Layer (Watchers)

**Detects:**

- Emails
- File changes
- Scheduled tasks
- Business triggers

Creates structured **Markdown tasks** inside the Vault.

### 2️⃣ Reasoning Layer

**Claude:**

- Reads `/Needs_Action`
- Generates `Plan.md`
- Applies guardrails
- Manages state transitions

**State Flow:**

```
Inbox → Needs_Action → Pending_Approval → Approved → Done
```

### 3️⃣ Action Layer (MCP)

**Integrated:**

- Email execution
- LinkedIn drafting
- Odoo accounting (JSON-RPC)
- File operations

Sensitive actions require human approval.

### ☁️ Cloud Zone

- 24/7 monitoring
- Draft creation
